My home is now denver. But throughout my life, home has been many different places. I was born in a small town in Upstate New York.  The town was small enough that I started my education in a one-room schoolhouse.

At a young age I moved to a much larger town in central New Jersey.

<P>
It was not until my junior year of high school that I was part of a small community once again. When I graduated it was with 21 other students.  As soon as I moved out on my own I made conscious decisions to live in smaller rural towns away from the masses.  Throughout my life I have had glimpses of living in small towns or being a part of a small community.  

<P>
At a young age I found myself exploring the environment near my home whenever possible.  I mostly explored natural places, off the beaten path that had not yet fallen to the hand of "progress" and greed. When I was young it was by foot and bicycle.  As I grew older I took to the open road by car or motorcycle.

In February of 2002 I began to journey to the Eastern Plains of Colorado.  Traveling the back roads as much as possible, I began photographing the places and people I came across on my journeys.  In a setting that was so unfamiliar to me, so barren and harsh, something quite unexpected happened. I felt at home.

<P>
The more time I spent traveling out east, the more I begin to wonder what it would have been like to spend more of my life living in a rural environment. I consider myself fortunate to have lived in both rural and urban places.  

<P>
Denver will not always be my home. In the future I plan to live in other places. At this time I don't know where.  But I guess anywhere you live is home.
