		<p>
		Ruth Kolman Brophy is an Austrian artist living in California.  Her work is influenced by her life experiences on both continents and by her unflagging optimism. The art that surrounded her during a childhood in Austria stays vividly in her imagination and the exuberance of color and the recurring groups of people in her work are a  reminder of those early
		artistic memories.
		</p>

		<p>
		She has received training at the Kunstschule in Linz (now University of Art and Industrial Design), and at the University of Oregon and the School of the Chicago Art Institute. She continued her studies at the University of Minnesota, the Minneapolis College of Art and Design and at the School of Visual Arts in New York City. She has taught numerous workshops and was appointed to the adjunct faculty at Hamline University in St. Paul, Minnesota.
