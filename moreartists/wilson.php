		<h2>Pat Wilson</h2>

		<p>	
		Explorations in monoprinting provide an immediate creative expression for me. I have combined printmaking and book arts to create a concertina (an accordion book) on shamans that includes monoprint shaman images, and poetry relating to the images printed on a letterpress. I hand set the poetry with lead type and printed it on a Vandercook letterpress at Mills College Book Arts Department. The printmaking paper is BFK Rives, a French cotton rag paper suitable for both printmaking and letterpress.

		Currently, I live in Vancouver, Washington, where organic gardening, herbal concoctions, and Reiki mastery are endeavors along with some printmaking in a cooperative Portland studio.

		<h3>Statement about "Sing Heavenly Muse"</h3>
		<p>
		The Shaman images originated from my study of South Pecos River cave drawings, coupled with an interest in American Indian history and my mother's family Choctaw lineage.
