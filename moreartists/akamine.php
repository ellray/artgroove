		<p>After 15 years of experimenting with 
		  textiles, what began as a fling with weaving has grown into a commitment. 
		  Here am I, patiently thinking up ever exotic concoctions to feed 
		  my loom while this evolving world seems to constantly elude its 
		  need for this stodgy, well-worn craft. I have found meaning as well 
		  in an environmental lesson: like weaving itself - plastic, adaptable, 
		  utilitarian, connected, flexible, intimate.
