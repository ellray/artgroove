		<p>
		The artgroove.com Refund Policy is designed to ensure that you will be happy with any purchase you make from us.
		</p>
		<p>Within 10 days (not business days) of receipt of any piece of art you buy from us, if you are dissatisfied with the art, you must contact us by phone or email and tell us of your intention to return the 
		art--you must pay the packing and shipping both ways. We will refund your purchase price when we receive the art in good condition--we must receive it within 30 days from the day you contact us. You are 
		responsible for its condition until it reaches us. You should send it using a shipping service that has tracking and insurance capabilities.
		</p>
		<p>Thank you</p>
