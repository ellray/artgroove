		<h2>About the Artgroove Online Gallery</h2>

		<p>
		This online gallery provides access to a searchable database of the known artworks by Carolyn Ellingson.  You can use either of the two types of search (by characteristics, or by keyword) to retrieve thumbnail images -- you can then choose to click on a thumbnail image to open a page with a larger size image.  Please be aware that the database contains more than 1,900 images, so limiting your search is highly recommended.
		</p>
		<p>
		The gallery represents the persistent efforts of the artist to create these works, and to document them when or before she sold them.  After Carolyn's death in April, 2002, the artist's family began to gather and organize all available information about her known works for a database/catalog.  For the case where all of the "data" for a given work has been found, the record of the work consists of the digital image, title, dimensions, medium, materials, year, owner, and miscellaneous notes (such as the history or quality of the piece).
		</p>
		<p>
		We have now arrived at an updatable archive of Carolyn's artwork, intended to provide access to her images through the Internet for friends and collectors.  We intend to continue to gather additional information on these works, adding new pieces as we become aware of them, and substituting higher quality images as we gain access to them.
		</p>
		<p>
		If you have information about original artworks by Carolyn, in any medium, please close this window and use the Contact link at left to let us know -- we'd be grateful to hear from you.  If you are the owner of a piece already included in the database, we'd appreciate knowing who you are.  We maintain a private (offline) record of the contact information for the many owners of Carolyn's work.  We do not share contact information (email or physical addresses) with anyone outside of our small (family-run) organization. 
		</p>
		<p>
		Thank you for your interest in Carolyn's art!
