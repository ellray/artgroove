		<h4>EDUCATION</h4>
		<p>
		After graduating from Whitman College with a bachelors degree in Psychology I went back to Whitman for additional undergraduate classes in fine art and art history, then moved to San Francisco where I attended the SF Art Institute and finished my masters in painting in 1984.

		<h4>ARTIST'S STATEMENT</h4>
		<p>
		I spend more time in museums than I do in galleries--- I like looking at mixed content and the various stylistic approaches on display when different artists and periods are represented. Subject matter for my paintings tends to  jump around:   landscapes to nudes to abstracters--whatever happens to be of interest to me right then. Most of my paintings are started with a loosely drawn sketch, the imagery then evolving by degrees into or away from something that resembles what we think of as reality. While I'm not overly interested in "objective" reality I am often enthralled by the way it looks.
