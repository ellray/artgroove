		<p>I am a biotechnologist/scientist/artist who took up oil painting at the 
		  age of 50 after many years of visiting the world's art galleries. 
		  I realized I was &quot;visually&quot; oriented at the age of 31 
		  while making my best discovery in a microscope. I love color and 
		  strikingly beautiful images - especially abstract and strikingly 
		  unusual biology images. I love big paintings.

		<p>A few of my favorite painters include Hans Hoffman, Nicolas De Stael, 
		  Piet Mondrian, Robert Delauney, Carolyn Ellingson, Joan Mitchell, 
		  Helen Frankenthaller, Vasily Kandinski and Henri Matisse. Do not 
		  like Pollock, Motherwell, Rothko. I am just learning but I have 
		  the chance to become very successful artist - people like my paintings 
		  - they are upbeat. Save my paintings, they will be worth a ton of 
		  money someday. This is just my first decade - I heard artists do 
		  their best in their 2nd decade. Watch out!
