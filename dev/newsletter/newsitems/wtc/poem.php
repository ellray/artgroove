				<h3>The Long War</h3>
				<p>Less passionate the long war throws <br />
				its burning thorn about all men, <br />
				caught in one grief, we share one wound<br />
				and cry one dialect of pain.
				</p>
				<p>We have forgot who fired the house, <br />
				whose easy mischief spilt first blood,<br />
				under one raging roof we lie <br />
				the fault no longer understood.
				</p>
				<p>But as twisted arms embrace<br />
				the desert where our cities stood, <br />
				death's family likeness in each face<br />
				must show, at last, our brotherhood.
				</p>
				<p>- Laurie Lee (1914-1997)<br />
				English poet, memoirist, and novelist, best-known for 
				his autobiographical trilogy CIDER WITH ROSIE (1959), 
				AS I WALKED OUT ONE MIDSUMMER MORNING (1969), and A MOMENT 
				OF WAR (1991).
				</p>
				<p>The trilogy depicts Lee's boyhood in the country, his journey 
				to London to seek his fortune and see the world, and his 
				experiences in the Spanish Civil War.
