				<p>A formal announcement came over the intercom for everyone to stay at their desks...
				</p>
				<p>The problem was in the other building, they were told.
				</p>
				<p>People from 80 countries died in this attack (sometimes I heard 60 countries).
				</p>
				<p>It's October 2. The attacks happened September 11. I still don't feel any anger. I just feel sadness and fear--for 
				the whole world.

				<p>Why can't I feel anger?
