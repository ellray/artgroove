				<p>My skin isn't scorched by fire, but I find myself trying to imagine what that would be like...

				<p>My hand goes to my throat wondering about flight attendants killed by box cutters...
				</p>
				<p>People jumped from the hundredth and something floor rather than burn to death - now what would <span class="italic">that</span> be like? What does a person feel in such a free fall?
				</p>
				<p>I wonder how I would bear such a gruesome fate--I can't even bear to <span class="italic">think</span> about it!
				</p>
				<p>IMAGINE THAT... I worry about my <span class="italic">own</span> skin.
