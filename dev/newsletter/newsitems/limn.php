			An event at LIMN in San Francisco is a place you want to be. And LIMN is now having a huge event <a href="http://www.limn.com/events.php" target="_blank">(see their Events)</a>--a week of celebration of 20 years of furniture, art, and accessories design for the home and office. For 7 days and 7 nights, July 23-29, 2001, LIMN is opening its showroom doors and has invited friends and fans to join them for exhibitions, art, speakers, live performances, live music, food, and visual stimulation of the highest order. LIMN is classy, hip, and has a commitment to drop-dead contemporary design. There is nothing like it anywhere around here, or maybe anywhere at all.

			<p>
			Even the space (especially the space) at LIMN is beautifully designed--and for San Francisco it is seemingly endless space. One can walk through what feels like one immense open showroom at LIMN and yet come upon many smaller, more intimate areas of interest created with what seems to be almost effortless artfulness. A see-through window in a wall here, a hanging something or another there, a special ceiling treatment, a change of flooring that surprises. In fact there are surprises every which way you turn.
			</p>
			<p>
			LIMN has an art gallery and a restaurant (the restaurant is a short walk from the showroom). The art gallery is first rate, with regular shows of edgy art that goes well with their mostly Italian-designed furniture. Between the gallery and the showrooms is an open courtyard where food and/or drinks are served during most of their events.
			</p>
			<p>
			You can walk back through the same space again and again at LIMN and still see new things you missed the first time around. Everything astonishes, delights and surprises your eye--a chair that lights up from the inside, an area rug that incorporates a bump that turns out to be a built-in bean bag type chair (later reading a catalog I see it's a built-into-the-carpet neck and head rest), a sitting area that resembles bleachers (for home movies?), drawers and shelves with surprising features and details. Even the flower arrangements are out of this world. You are allowed, invited even, to sit on the fab furniture and soak up your surroundings.
			</p>

			And it looks and feels good, really good, all of it. People-watching at LIMN events is almost as good as absorbing the killer design. Visit LIMN and see for yourself.
