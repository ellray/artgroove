		Good news! One of my images, Mastermind, is going to be reproduced on 
		the cover of a book. A professor of literature in Cordoba, Spain, 
		Antonio Ruiz, contacted me to ask permission to use this image on 
		his new book about the 19th century Canadian novel which is to be 
		published this October. Of course I was honored to have been asked 
		and did give my permission.

		Professor Ruiz found me by searching in Yahoo and typing in the &quot;art 
		section&quot;: abstract paintings, getting Arts &gt; Visual Arts 
		&gt; Painting &gt; Artists &gt; Personal Exhibits (and there was 
		my website with the image he liked so much).
