				<h1>Seminar: How to Sell Your Art Yourself on the Internet</h1>
				<h4>&copy;2001 Carolyn Ellingson, artgroove.com &reg;</h4> 
			</div>
			<p>
			I teach a seminar on how to get started selling your art yourself 
			on the Internet. I will give this seminar for an individual or several 
			artists. It's not guaranteed to make you a Web Wizard or to get 
			you any specific amount of sales.
			</p>
			<p>
			But it does go over what is involved and has ideas for getting started 
			with this venture. It helps to have computer skills and know some 
			software that optimizes images, creates Web pages, etc. However, 
			without heavy duty computer skills you can put art up for auction 
			on eBay.
			</p>
			<p>
			And you can start learning the things you need to know to do more. 
			The Web isn't as hot a property as it was before the dot com bomb, 
			but it's not going to go away. Art isn't selling like hotcakes right 
			now either, as you may have noticed. But right now is as good a 
			time as any to start getting up to speed to utilize this great marketing 
			tool. Things will turn around and you can be ready.
			</p>
			<p>
			See this <a href="../../workshop.html">write-up</a> of the seminar
			</p>
			<p>
			The new price for my seminar is $200.00 which includes 6 hours of discussion, 
			information, and demos and you will go home with a large binder 
			that covers the things we talk about. I recently raised the price 
			on this seminar to reflect the skills, time,and preparation involved 
			at my end.
