				<p>Carolyn's studio (Bldg 101, #1202) at <a href="http://www.thepointart.com" target="_blank">Hunters Point Shipyard</a> in San Francisco served as a source of great happiness for her.  She enjoyed the warm sunshine, working on her art, the solitude, but also her friends who shared Building 101 with her over the years.  Carolyn participated enthusiastically in each of the Open Studio weekends held twice each year.  She sent out invitation cards to many of her collectors and fans, and more recently posted online versions as well.  Carolyn's last online invitation appears here, for the Spring 2002 Open Studio show she had planned:  <a href="./invitation.php">Spring 2002 Open Studio Invitation</a>.
