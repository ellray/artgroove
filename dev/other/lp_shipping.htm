			<h3>Step 1:  Remove Record and Sleeve from Jacket</h3>
			<p>Separating the record/sleeve from the jacket prevents the record from sliding into the edge of the jacket (when the postal service drops the package on an edge) and cutting through the jacket (the notorious "seam split").
			</p>
			
			<div class="float_box left_float">
				<h3 class="bold red">DON'T:</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>allow tape to touch any part of the record/sleeve/jacket!</li>
					<li>pack loosely in the shipping box, allowing the LP to impact the inside of the box during handling</li>
					<li>use such thin packaging that it could be damaged by a gouge or be bent (generally hard on vinyl  :-)</li>
				</ul>
			</div>

			<h3>Step 2:  Place the Record in a Plastic Protector</h3>
			<p>The record/sleeve/jacket should now be slid into a record protector sleeve (ideally).  If you don't have a plastic record protector sleeve, you can improvise a similarly protective cover--saran wrap, bubble wrap (though the added thickness may prevent easy insertion into an LP shipping box), or newspaper (a couple layers, taped into place, CAREFULLY!).
			</p>
			
			<h3>Step 3:  Spacer Inserts</h3>
			<p>No matter what shipping container you use, it is best to use spacers inside the box to provide protection against gouges to the package and also to provide additional stiffness.
			</p>

			<p>
			There are specifically designed cardboard squares that are slightly smaller than LPs that are perfect for this--one on each side of the LP is great.  Failing this, you can easily cut your own 12-3/8&quot; x 12-3/8&quot; cardboards.  Another excellent option is using junk record jackets (including the junk vinyl will also provide your package with additional resistance to bending).  Small-bubble bubble-wrap can also be used--simply cut to the LP size.  The bubble-wrap won't provide any stiffness obviously, and I have had one record arrive cracked from bending in a record box.
			</p>
			
			<h3>Step 4:  The Shipping Container</h3>
			<p>The ideal shipping container is one of the boxes designed for shipping LPs.  If you are a collector, you may have these around from one of your purchases.  Otherwise they can be ordered for less than 50 cents each from any number of online vendors (see my list of supplies at the end of the page).  The most common ones have different folding lines to accommodate from 1 to about 4 albums.
			</p>
			<div class="right_float float_box">
				<h2>Supplies</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>shipping boxes</li>
					<li>plastic protective outer sleeves</li>
					<li>small-bubble bubble wrap or cardboard inserts</li>
					<li>good quality packing tape (that won't come unstuck)</li>
					<li>(optional, but highly recommended!) postage scale</li>
				</ul>
				<p>All of the above can easily be located on the web with minimal effort.</p>
			</div>

			<p>Failing to have a special LP box, the best option is to cut a couple pieces of oversized cardboard, maybe 14&quot; x 14&quot; or so, and sandwich the LP and insert spacers between them, taping them tightly at the edges.
			</p>
			
			<h3>Final Step:  Labeling and Posting</h3>
			<p>If you're selling via Amazon or eBay, you can use their seller services to pay for and print your shipping label.  I highly recommend this--you get delivery confirmation cheaply along with the Media Mail (assuming your buyer hasn't paid for expedited shipping) postage, and you get to simply drop your package at the post office--no more waiting in lines!  ***All you need to make this easy is an inexpensive postage scale.***
			</p>
			<p>
			Lastly, label the box <span class="bold red">FRAGILE</span> and <span class="bold red">DO NOT BEND</span> front and back.  You can simply print this with a marker.  The PO may ignore it, but it tells your buyer that you were as careful as possible and did your best to arrange for gentle handling.

			<p>I put this guide together because I wasn't quite satisfied with any of the ones that I found on the web, though <a href="http://www.emeraldcityaudiophile.com/shipping/shipping.html">Scott Taylor's</a> covers the ideal shipping methods well.  When I list a number of options for a particular packing step in my guide, they are listed from best to worst.
