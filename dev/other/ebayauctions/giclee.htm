        IS A GICLEE PRINT?<br>
        </b> <font size="1">by Carolyn Ellingson </font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A giclee 
        print is a print produced on an ink jet printer with archival, lab tested 
        inks that coat the paper or canvas with pigment. Giclees are popularly 
        known as &quot;Iris&quot; prints, but technically only prints printed 
        on Iris brand printers are Iris prints. My pink image was printed on an 
        actual Iris printer by Redwood Editions</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">High resolution 
        is possible, as much as 1800 dpi. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Giclee fine 
        art prints are usually produced by scanning in the image from a 4x5 or 
        larger transparency, after which they are printed digitally.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One testing 
        entity has found these prints to perfectly retain their color fastness 
        from 25-200 years depending on materials used and the conditions under 
        which they exist.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Giclees should 
        be treated much as watercolors are treated and cared for. They can fade 
        if kept in bright light. But their lightfastness has improved greatly 
        in the past few years.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Giclees can 
        be printed on demand (the whole edition does not need to be printed at 
        once). The image can be tweaked to be even better than the original image. 
        The visual quality is extremely high, the color reproduction very true 
        to the original.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">They are 
        fairly expensive to produce because of the cost of inks, paper, specialist 
        time, length of time the machine requires to produce the print (maybe 
        an hour to produce one sheet). The machines can cost up to $25,000 and 
        the paper can be expensive as well.</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">My 
        giclees have been printed with archival inks and papers.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Giclees are 
        less expensive than originals and look very, very good. It's a way to 
        make a popular image available to more than one person at a price more 
        can afford.</font></p>
