		<h2>About the Keyword(s) Search</h2>

		<p>
		Searching for artworks by a keyword or phrase provides a powerful way to find one or more pieces.  This search will return all pieces which include the entered word or phrase, either exactly or as a subset of an entry in the <span class="bold_italic">title, materials, medium(media), year, comments,</span> or <span class="bold_italic">item ID#</span>.  For example, entering 'red' would not only return pieces referenced by the word 'red', but also pieces with the word 'altered'.
		</p>
		<p>
		Searching by a phrase is more specific:  searching on 'red watercolor' returns only those pieces referenced specifically by this phrase (though if it existed, a piece titled 'altered watercolor' would also be returned).
		</p>
		<p>
		The keyword(s) search can also be used to search by the year, for example.  To give you additional ideas for keyword searches, please note the following information about Carolyn's artwork.
		</p>
		<p>
		The "Medium" categories we have used to catalog Carolyn's work are as follows:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Painting:  can be oil, acrylic, watercolor, or gouache.</li>
			<li>Drawing:  frequently done in ink or with pastels</li>
			<li>Print:  most common are <a href="faq.php">monotypes</a>; also includes intaglio and silkscreen.  Unlike reproductions, each of these is a unique artpiece.</li>
			<li> Mixed media:  common examples are monotype with painting, or monotype with collage</li>
			<li> Other (collage, batik, tee-shirt):  a general category which encompasses any collage, plus works done on fabric</li>
		</ul>
