            <h2>About Carolyn</h2>
            <p>
                Carolyn Ellingson was a San Francisco artist known for strong abstract images and clean, decisive and exciting color.  Carolyn was born in Chicago and moved with her family as a child to Minneapolis where she eventually earned advanced degrees from The University of Minnesota. She moved to California in 1983 and maintained a studio at <a href="http://www.thepointart.com" target="new">Hunter's Point Shipyard</a>. She focused on creating non-representational oil and acrylic paintings, monotypes, pastels and watercolors.  Carolyn died of mesothelioma on April 26, 2002;  <a href="obituary.php">her obituary can be read here</a>.  Carolyn's artist bio (as she wrote it) can be <a href="artistbio.php"> read here</a>.

            <h3>Carolyn's June 1997 interview in Feminista!</h3>
            <p>
                Carolyn was interviewed by the now-defunct webzine, <span class="bold_italic">"Feminista!"</span> in 1997, and spoke about how she became an artist in spite of all the challenges she faced coming from being a stay-at-home mother of the '60s.  The article was published with numerous images of Carolyn's art and was titled, <span class="bold">"Pick up the brush, the chalk, the clay"</span>.</p><p>
                Carolyn had this to say about the interview:  "I never considered myself a feminist <span class="italic">per se</span>, but perhaps I am after all-- read this interview and decide for yourself.  I believe every woman has at least a few feminist stories in her life repertoire. The interview conducted by Leigh Anne Jones reveals what I feel it's like to be an artist here in San Francisco, and what I thinks it takes for anyone to be an artist."
            </p><p>
                The <span class="bold_italic">Feminista!</span> website is down, but <a href="./FeministaInterview">the interview can be found here</a>.  It is several pages long, but if you're interested in Carolyn's art or personal background, it's not to be missed.

            <h3>Special Art Collections</h3>
            <a href="./gallery/crash/captions.php"><span class="big_link">crash</span></a>
            <p>
                A special exhibition in memory of <a href="./BillBateman">Bill Bateman</a> who died February 20, 1997 at age 49 after being hit by a car in Oakland, California, USA. The <a href="./gallery/crash/captions.php">special exhibit</a> uses captions from "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crash_%281973_novel%29">Crash</a>," the book by J. G. Ballard. Ballard wrote "Crash" in 1973 and it was recently made into a movie directed by David Cronenberg who also did Scanners, The Fly, and Naked Lunch. The movie is a study in the modern search for intensity, eschews morality and breaks the boundaries of "normal." Ballard forsees our coming "autogeddon."

                In 1995 this image of <span class="italic">Formalities, I</span> was accepted for an international electronic art networking project, The World's Women Online.  It was also projected as part of an installation piece created by Artist Muriel Magenta from Arizona State University which wove the Internet images with video sequences at the 1995 UN conference in Beijing.
