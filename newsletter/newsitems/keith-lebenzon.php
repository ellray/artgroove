		I could <span class="italic">not</span> do my artwork without Keith Lebenzon's brushes! 
		This is the truth. I use them all the time. They are handmade, beautiful 
		brushes that have hand carved handles. They hold a heavy paint load 
		and release just the amount I want released. They come to a one 
		hair point at the tip! These brushes are not inexpensive but they 
		are worth every penny of the price. There is nothing else like them 
		anywhere.
		</p>
		<p>
		I bought two more of them to add to my collection today at the ACC 
		Craft Show which is running right now at Fort Mason in San Francisco 
		and decided to write about Keith in my newsletter today.
		</p>
		<p>
		From his flyer I learned that Keith Lebenzon was a potter who had developed 
		a distinctive glazing style. His work with ceramic imagery led 
		him to also develop these amazing handmade artist brushes.
		</p>
		<p>
		Lebenzon 
		began making brushes for his own use in 1971. Since that time 
		he has experimented extensively with various natural materials. 
		Although he varies the character of his brushes through the materials 
		used, a few common characteristics stand out. Their durability 
		is outstanding the brushes are typically smooth in their release 
		of fluid. They can be pulled to a fine a delicate line while retaining 
		great capacity. Lebenzon pays special attention to the handle 
		as well, creating a brush that is not only functional but also 
		an object of art in itself.
		</p>
		<p>
		You 
		have to try these brushes at his booth at the Craft Show to appreciate 
		what I'm saying.
