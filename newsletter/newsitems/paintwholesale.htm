		Today I talked with the owner of a well-known artist's oil paint company and asked him why we professional artists can't buy our paint wholesale, even if we have a business license and a resale license. This problem has bothered me for a long time.

		This person explained that it is hobbyists who buy the largest share of oil paint in this country, not professional artists. More than 90% of ads for art supplies go into two publications, both for hobbyists. Since hobbyists are the ones buying the most paint, the system is set up for hobbyists to buy (retail) <span class="italic">not</span> for professional artists to buy wholesale.
