			<p>These watercolors were done by me about some of my thoughts and feelings 
			regarding the September 11, 2001, terrorist attack on the people 
			of New York City, our country and our people.

			<p>Thanks to Ned Bateman for bringing the poems to my attention.
			</p>
			<p>These little watercolors weren't made for sale.
			</p>
			<p>As things have progressed since the attack itself, I have had many 
			different thoughts and feelings. My knowledge of the various 
			facts and complexities of our dilemma has grown considerably. 
			But these paintings illustrate some of the feelings and thoughts 
			I had at the outset. Except for one page I completed on October 
			2 where I mention my realization that I have been unable to 
			feel anger, a fact that seems very strange and inappropriate, 
			given the damage done to us all, particularly the people killed 
			and injured.
			</p>
			<p>I am feeling more reassured now that we are seeking other ways 
			to deal with the situation, that we are gathering the support 
			of other countries and are thinking through the situation and 
			are pursuing alternatives to a military attack (which still 
			will be likely to come).
			</p>
			<p>We can't just sit here passively of course. I always feel so 
			sad though that our world hasn't progressed to methods of conflict 
			resolution that doesn't involve mass killings of civilians and 
			huge loss of military personnel. We are still killing each other, 
			most often in the name of some god.
