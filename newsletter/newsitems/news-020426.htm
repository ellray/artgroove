	<p>Dear Friends and Collectors of Carolyn Ellingson,
	</p>
	<p>
	Early in 2002, Carolyn was struck by mesothelioma, an asbestos-related lung cancer.  Following a brief illness, she died April 26th in Liberty Lake, WA, where she had relocated April 1st to live with family.  A memorial celebration, fittingly moving and spirited, was held May 18th in her art studio at Hunters Point Shipyard, San Francisco.  Carolyn's obituary, as it appeared in the May 8th San Francisco Chronicle, follows at the end of this email.
