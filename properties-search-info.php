		<h2>About the Properties Search</h2>

		<p>
		Searching for artworks by their characteristics is generally straightforward.  Choose from one or more combinations of the provided options, Medium, Materials, and/or Size (by width, in inches).  Note that searching on a given Material will bring up any piece with that word, so that a search on 'oil' could bring up both an 'oil on canvas' (a type of painting), or a drawing done with 'oil pastel' ( a type of drawing).  Choosing 'any' (the default selection) for one of the search options <span class="bold_italic">does not exclude any piece based on that option</span>.
		</p>
		<p>
		The "Medium" categories we have used to catalog Carolyn's work are as follows:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Painting:  can be oil, acrylic, watercolor, or gouache.</li>
			<li>Drawing:  frequently done in ink or with pastels</li>
			<li>Print:  most common are <a href="faq.php">monotypes</a>; also includes intaglio and silkscreen.  Unlike reproductions, each of these is a unique artpiece.</li>
			<li>Mixed media:  common examples are monotype with painting, or monotype with collage</li>
			<li>Other (collage, batik, tee-shirt):  a general category which encompasses any collage, plus works done on fabric</li>
		</ul>
