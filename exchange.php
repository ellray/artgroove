		<h2>artgroove.com Exchange Policy</h2>
		<p>The artgroove.com Exchange Policy is meant to cover instances where a collector buys an item, takes it home and is just not happy with it. This Policy is not meant to allow exchanges well after the date of purchase just to get something different; we are not a library :-).
		</p>
		<p>Anytime within a 14-day period after purchase, a piece of art may be exchanged (not returned for credit or cash) for another piece of art of at least the same value in the event that the buyer cannot bear to live with the piece. A piece of art taken home on loan for the purpose of seeing if it will work out is another matter and may possibly be arranged.
		</p>
		<p>Thank you.</p>
